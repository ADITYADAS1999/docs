# Contributing

Contributing to this project is welcomed for anyone to do! You can fork this
repository and make a pull request. Make sure you fill in the appropriate pull
request templates! If you want to make a more drastic change than just an extra
paragraph/page/sentence, be sure to first discuss this in an issue. Again, if
you decide to write an issue, use the correct templates here as well!
