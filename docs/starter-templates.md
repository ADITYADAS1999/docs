# Starter Templates

## Official Battlesnake Templates

These GitHub templates are built and maintained by the Battlesnake team. We do our best to keep them functional and up-to-date with the latest game features. If something doesn't work as you'd expect, or needs updating, [please let us know](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions) so we can make changes :)

If you're building a Battlesnake for the first time, these are great starting points.

* **[Python Template](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-python)**
* **[Go Template](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-go)**
* **[JavaScript Template](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-javascript)**
* **[TypeScript Template](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-typescript)**
* **[Rust Template](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/starter-snake-rust)**

It is recommended to click the green **Use this Template** button to bring a clean copy of the starter code into your own GitHub account. You are also welcome to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) one of these repos instead, but please do not submit Pull Requests back to the template repo.

## Community Starter Projects

The Battlesnake community is all about collaboration and shared learning. Some of our core members and partners have built their own projects to get developers started with new languages and technologies.

**These projects are maintained independently by their developers.** See project guidelines for each project if you're interested in getting involved or have any questions/concerns.

### Legacy Starter Projects

The following starter projects use a deprecated version of the Battlesnake API. They're still great starting points, but require some additional updates to work correctly.

### Contributing Your Own Starter Project

**Want to submit your starter project to this list?** Wonderful!

Community starter projects must follow these guidelines in order to be listed:

* Contain just enough code to run a simple Battlesnake and nothing more
* Be well documented and easy to understand
* Provide a simple, extensible unit test setup
* Ideally have a minimal project structure

If your project fits, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/docs) or [start a feedback thread](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions) and we'll take a look!
