# Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know how to program to play Battlesnake?

Battlesnake is best for those with beginner-level programming skills and above. You'll need to know the basics of responding to web requests in least one programming language to get started.

If you're brand new to programming and want to start learning - awesome, we're happy you're here! We're constantly working on ways to help you get started. In the meantime, you might want to get started with some online programming courses and tutorials to get the basics down.

### Is Battlesnake only for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence?

Nope, you can use _any technology, tools, and algorithms_ you want to power your Battlesnake! It doesn't have to be built with Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence - in fact, many developers have great success writing simple programs and decision trees that employ specific and creative strategies.

We suggest you start with the technologies you're comfortable with and expand to include new things you want to learn.

### Which cloud provider and region should I use?

You can be a successful Battlesnake developer on almost any cloud provider, hosted anywhere around the world. Your cloud provider choice has no impact on your ability to play the game and we encourage you to explore and learn new things.

If you are wanting to compete at the highest level and are worried about optimizing location and round-trip latency, you may want to host your Battlesnake inside one of the supported game engine regions.

### What can I do with my Battlesnake?

* **Challenges** provide a “single-player campaign” of Battlesnake. It’s just you and the puzzle you need to solve. They're a great way to test and build up your skills in prep for Battlegrounds & Leagues. [See guide](guides/playing-battlesnake/challenges).
* **Battlegrounds** are a rotating series of monthly leaderboards. Test your skills against other developers by putting your Battlesnakes into ladders, each with unique maps and game modes. Matches run between a set time each day, allowing you to make tweaks and changes to your code in-between matches. [See guide.](guides/playing-battlesnake/battlegrounds)
* **Leagues** are limited-time competitions where the best of the best compete for title, prizes, and prestige! They’re only held a few times each year and the finals are streamed live on Twitch. Has your Battlesnake got what it takes? [See guide.](guides/playing-battlesnake/leagues)


### How does food appear on the board?

The algorithm used to generate food is dependent on the map and game mode being played. In standard games, there is a 15% chance on every turn for food to spawn in a single random unoccupied location. There are additional algorithms tasked with maintaining a minimum amount of food on the board at all times.

[The code powering all food spawn decisions is open source](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules) and we encourage you to explore these algorithms directly to learn all the details.
